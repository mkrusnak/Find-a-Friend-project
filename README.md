# PROJECT2 Find-a-Friend
This is full stack project built with NodeJs, ExpressJs, HandlebarsJs, MongoDB and Axios.
Find-a-Friend is a pet adoption website that lets give you info about all the animals available for adoption in real time. 
User can set the filters such as location/pet-type/age/size to find a pet that fits their needs. You can also search for pet organizations in USA.
So if user wants to contribute to the community they can find nerby organization and contact them directly to volunteer or foster.
You can also list pet-related things for sale, read pet-ralated articles and more.
This project has full CRUD implemented. I used Express Session as authenication method for a user.
