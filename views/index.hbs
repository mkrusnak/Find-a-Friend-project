    <h1>Why adoption over buying</h1>
    
    <p>Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here looking to adopt a pet? Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog or cat, and rightly so, there are many benefits to adopting a pet. Pet adoption fees are usually much lower than buying from a breeder. You’re also likely to find a pet who’s already learned a few things. Adoptable pets are often already housetrained, good with kids, and do well with other pets. And don’t forget the wonderful feeling you get from saving a life!</p>

    <h1>Adoption helps more than just one animal</h1>
    <p>When you adopt a new pet, you are not just helping the one you have adopted but you also end up making room for another pet in the shelter. Every year overburdened animal shelters take in millions of pets, they need your help to reduce this number by adopting.</p>
