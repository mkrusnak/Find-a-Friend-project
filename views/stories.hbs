    <h2>Monkey: 30 pounds of irresistible</h2>
<p>              
    Monkey is a cat so cute, it’s like he’s got his own gravity. When the 31-pound cat first arrived at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, everyone was drawn to him and his outgoing personality. And he loved the attention. It wasn’t just people who met him in person, either. When Jennifer May saw his picture on the Best Friends website, she saw his big green eyes and was pulled in like everyone else before traveling more than 300 miles to pick him up.
The happy ending didn’t stop there, though. When Jennifer came to get Monkey, she fell in love with two more cats - brothers Jupiter and Saturn. And, so, Monkey’s gravity of cuteness pulled two little planets all the way home with him.

   <h2>Steak: Big orange tabby is living large in the Lone Star State</h2>
<p>              
    Steak has a way of stealing the spotlight like only a big orange tabby cat can. That’s what Diane Barber discovered when she stepped up to foster him during the pandemic. He became an instant hit during virtual happy hours with Diane’s friends and reigned supreme over her Facebook page.
    That’s where Steak caught the attention of Diane’s friend, Doug Parker. But there was just one logistical conundrum: Doug lives in Houston. How in the world could Steak get from California to Texas?
    Diane had the answer: She and her partner would drive Steak to his new home with Doug.

   <h2>Diesel: A pig who knows when to turn on the charm</h2>
<p>              
    Sometimes, it’s the pet who chooses the person. That’s exactly what Diesel did when Jennifer West came looking for a pig to adopt. He plopped down next to her and turned on the charm. Now, Diesel was known for being rambunctious and insecure at the Sanctuary, and Jennifer had heard about his personality. She’d already decided that he was probably not the right match, but when they met, Diesel turned on the charm. Even his caregivers noted that he was like a completely different pig ― all gentle and mellow. When a pig decides you’re the one, how can you say no?

   <h2>Sailor: Deaf dog meets the perfect match</h2>
<p>              
    When Allison Arnold and her partner, Lily, moved into their new home, they took one look at the big backyard and knew what they had to do: adopt another dog. So, they started looking online at available pups. That’s when they first learned about Sailor, who was in the process of amassing quite a fan following at Best Friends in Atlanta.
    You see, there’s a lot to love about the young pit bull mix. He’s equal parts sweet and goofy, and so adorable.
    “We’ve always had a soft spot for animals, especially those that have been abandoned, have difficult circumstances or have special needs that require more care,” says Allison. “When we saw Sailor and learned he was deaf, we knew he was the one.”

   <h2>Romeo: The kitten who helped mend a broken heart</h2>
<p>              
    Twelve-year-old Lucas Sweeney was absolutely heartbroken when his beloved cat, Very Good Kitten (VGK), passed away recently. VGK was adopted a few years ago by the family and quickly became Lucas’ shadow. When he came home from school, he hung out with VGK, and at night they slept together soundly. In fact, it was Lucas who gave VGK his nickname.
    After VGK passed, Lucas’ mom, Laurie, decided the time was right to foster a cat, thinking it just might lift Lucas’ spirits. She signed the family up with Best Friends in Utah to become kitten fosters. Not too long after that, she hopped in the car with Lucas and picked up three kittens to foster, including a little black one named Romeo. “It was like he was sent from VGK,” says Laurie.
    Today all three kittens fostered by the Sweeney family have been adopted. Romeo didn’t even have to leave the house to make that happen. He’s now Lucas’ new special friend, proving that fostering (and adopting) really can cure a broken heart.

   <h2>Dakota: Shy dog learns life is nothing to be afraid of</h2>
<p>              
    For Dakota, new was always scary. When she was comfortable and with the people she loved, she was a snuggly couch potato. New faces, however, made her freeze up with nerves, unable to move until she felt safe again. It was no different when Michael and Alena Eberle met her for the first time. Dakota was nervous, and they wondered if she would be able to adjust well in their home. But they took a chance on her.
    At first it was hard, they said. She couldn’t relax, and they had to wake her up in the middle of the night when she had nightmares. With time and patience, she finally started to open up. Once she knew that these were her people and she was safe, she even started getting excited about going to work with them and meeting all sorts of new people. With her family beside her, new wasn’t scary anymore. It was fun.
